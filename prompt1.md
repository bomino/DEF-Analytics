# Healthcare Facilities Spend Analysis Prompt

## Task Overview
Perform a comprehensive spend analysis on healthcare procurement data with specific focus on 'In Scope' Facilities category transactions. Create visualizations, identify cost-saving opportunities, and develop strategic recommendations.

## Data Analysis Requirements
1. Import and analyze the procurement dataset (Excel format)
2. Filter for 'In Scope' items in the 'Facilities' category
3. Perform the following analyses:
   - Spend distribution by subcategory (identify top 3 subcategories by spend)
   - Vendor fragmentation analysis (count unique vendors per subcategory)
   - Pareto analysis (identify what percentage of vendors account for 80% of spend)
   - Monthly spend trend analysis (identify seasonal patterns and volatility)
   - Top vendor concentration (calculate spend percentage for top 5 vendors)

## Visualization Requirements
1. Create a Pareto chart showing vendor concentration (80/20 principle)
2. Generate a table showing top 5 vendors with spend amounts and percentages
3. Create a monthly spend trend line chart showing volatility patterns
4. Develop a subcategory spend breakdown visualization
5. Create a vendor fragmentation chart showing vendors per subcategory

## Opportunity Assessment Requirements
1. Identify and quantify savings opportunities in these categories:
   - Vendor Consolidation (calculate 8-12% potential savings)
   - Strategic Category Management (calculate 5-8% potential savings)
   - Procurement Process Optimization (calculate 3-5% potential savings)
   - Seasonal Optimization (calculate 8-15% potential savings)

2. Provide mathematical basis for all savings calculations:
   - Use compound savings approach: Total Savings = 1 - [(1 - Opportunity Savings) Ã— (1 - Seasonal Savings)]
   - Apply implementation adjustment factors (0.75-0.85) to account for execution challenges
   - Show all calculations with clear explanations

## Deliverables
1. Executive Summary (500-800 words) with:
   - Key findings highlighting subcategory concentration and vendor fragmentation
   - Pareto analysis results showing vendor concentration
   - Savings opportunities with percentages and implementation timelines
   - Strategic recommendations prioritized by impact and feasibility

2. Detailed Analysis Report including:
   - Data exploration methodology
   - Descriptive analysis of 'In Scope' Facilities spend
   - Vendor concentration and fragmentation analysis
   - Seasonal spending pattern analysis
   - Detailed opportunity assessment with mathematical basis for savings
   - Implementation roadmap with immediate, medium-term, and long-term priorities

3. Interactive Website Design (HTML/CSS/JS) featuring:
   - Responsive layout for desktop and mobile viewing
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Clearly organized sections for findings, opportunities, and recommendations
   - Proper handling of text overflow in pre-formatted elements

## Healthcare-Specific Considerations
1. Focus on facilities services critical to healthcare operations (HVAC, Electrical, Building Maintenance)
2. Consider impact of vendor consolidation on service reliability for critical healthcare infrastructure
3. Address compliance requirements specific to healthcare facilities
4. Emphasize strategies that minimize disruption to patient care during implementation

## Analysis Parameters
- Target total savings: 20-30% of annual facilities spend
- Implementation timeline: 12 months
- Prioritize subcategories by spend volume and vendor fragmentation
- Consider both cost savings and operational improvements in recommendations
